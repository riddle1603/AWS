## Q1. Explain the difference between AWS Regions, Availability Zones, and Edge Locations. Why is this important for data analysis and latency-sensitive applications?

**Answer:**

AWS infrastructure is organized into **Regions**, **Availability Zones (AZs)**, and **Edge Locations**, each serving different purposes to optimize performance, availability, and latency.

- **AWS Regions:** A Region is a geographically separate area around the world where AWS has data centers. Each Region contains multiple Availability Zones and operates independently. Examples include `us-east-1` (N. Virginia), `eu-west-1` (Ireland). Regions allow customers to deploy applications closer to their users or comply with local data regulations.

- **Availability Zones (AZs):** An Availability Zone is one or more discrete data centers within a Region that are engineered to be isolated from failures in other AZs. AZs provide high availability and fault tolerance by allowing users to deploy redundant resources across zones within the same Region.

- **Edge Locations:** Edge Locations are data centers located globally to serve content through the AWS Content Delivery Network (CloudFront). They cache copies of data closer to users to reduce latency and improve performance for content delivery.

**Why is this important for data analysis and latency-sensitive applications?**

For data analysis and latency-sensitive workloads, choosing the right Region and AZ is critical because it affects the speed and availability of data processing. Deploying resources in Regions close to data sources or end users reduces network latency. Using multiple AZs enhances fault tolerance and uptime for critical applications. Edge Locations improve response time by caching data nearer to users, which is essential for applications requiring fast content delivery and minimal delay.

## Q4: Compare different Amazon S3 storage classes (Standard, Intelligent-Tiering, Glacier). When should each be used in data analytics workflows?

**Answer:**

Amazon S3 offers multiple storage classes optimized for different use cases:

- **S3 Standard:**  
  - Designed for frequently accessed data.  
  - Provides low latency and high throughput.  
  - Best for active datasets and real-time analytics where quick access to data is crucial.  
  - Use Case: Storing raw or processed data actively queried or updated during analysis.

- **S3 Intelligent-Tiering:**  
  - Automatically moves data between two access tiers (frequent and infrequent) based on usage patterns.  
  - Ideal for datasets with unpredictable or changing access patterns.  
  - Saves cost without performance impact as it shifts data to cheaper tiers automatically.  
  - Use Case: When usage patterns are unknown or variable during analytics projects.

- **S3 Glacier:**  
  - Designed for archival and long-term backup.  
  - Much cheaper but retrieval takes minutes to hours.  
  - Suitable for historical data or audit logs that rarely need to be accessed but must be retained.  
  - Use Case: Storing old analytical data or backups that arenâ€™t accessed regularly but kept for compliance or trend analysis.

In data analytics workflows, choosing the right storage class balances cost with performance and access needs.

## Q8. Create a DynamoDB table and insert 3 records manually. Then write a Lambda function that adds records when triggered by S3 uploads.

**Answer:**

**1. Created DynamoDB Table**
I logged into the AWS Management Console, navigated to DynamoDB, and created a new table named `BharatTable` with `id` as the Partition Key (string).

**2. Inserted 3 Records Manually**
In the DynamoDB console, I selected the table, clicked on "Explore Table Items," then clicked "Create Item."  
I added the following 3 records in this format:
```json
{
  "id": { "S": "1" },
  "name": { "S": "Bharat" },
  "age": { "N": "23" }
}
```
**3. Wrote Lambda Function** 
- I wrote the following AWS Lambda function in Python. This function triggers on S3 upload events, reads the JSON file uploaded to S3, parses it, and inserts the data as a record in DynamoDB.

```python
import json
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client('s3')
dynamodb = boto3.client('dynamodb')
table_name = 'BharatTable'

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    for record in event['Records']:
        bucket = record['s3']['bucket']['name']
        key = record['s3']['object']['key']

        response = s3.get_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=key)
        content = response['Body'].read().decode('utf-8')

        data = json.loads(content)

        item = {}
        for k, v in data.items():
            if isinstance(v, int):
                item[k] = {'N': str(v)}
            else:
                item[k] = {'S': str(v)}

        dynamodb.put_item(TableName=table_name, Item=item)

    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps('Record inserted successfully')
    }
```
**4. Created S3 Bucket and Configured Trigger**
I created an S3 bucket and configured it to trigger the Lambda function on `PUT` object events.

**5. Tested Lambda by Uploading JSON Files**
I uploaded JSON files to the S3 bucket with content like:

```json
{
  "id": "4",
  "name": "Sam",
  "age": 22
}
```
After uploading, I verified in DynamoDB that the new record was inserted successfully.

**6. Verified Everything Worked**
Checked Lambda logs in CloudWatch to confirm no errors.

Checked DynamoDB table to confirm new items from S3 uploads were added.

## Q9. What is serverless computing? Discuss pros and cons of using AWS Lambda for data pipelines.

**Answer:**

Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. Developers write and deploy code without having to manage infrastructure, allowing them to focus on application logic. AWS Lambda is a popular serverless compute service that runs code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources.

**Pros of using AWS Lambda for data pipelines:**
- **Scalability:** Automatically scales based on the number of incoming events without manual intervention.
- **Cost-effective:** You pay only for the compute time you consume, no charges when code is not running.
- **Reduced operational overhead:** No need to manage servers or runtime environments.
- **Event-driven:** Integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, triggering functions based on data uploads, database changes, etc.

**Cons of using AWS Lambda for data pipelines:**
- **Execution time limits:** Functions have a maximum execution timeout (currently 15 minutes), which may be limiting for long-running tasks.
- **Cold start latency:** Initial invocation of functions can have latency, which might affect real-time data processing.
- **Resource limits:** Limited CPU, memory, and temporary storage compared to dedicated servers.
- **Complex debugging:** Distributed event-driven architecture can make debugging and monitoring more challenging.

2. **Created a Lambda function** named `LogS3UploadInfo`.
3. **Gave necessary permissions** to Lambda for S3 and CloudWatch.
4. **Set up S3 as a trigger** for the Lambda function (event type: `ObjectCreated`).
5. **Used the following Python code** in the Lambda function to log required details:

**Lambda Function Code:**

```python
import json
import boto3
from datetime import datetime

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    for record in event['Records']:
        bucket = record['s3']['bucket']['name']
        key = record['s3']['object']['key']
        size = record['s3']['object']['size']
        time = record['eventTime']

        print(f"File uploaded:")
        print(f"- Bucket: {bucket}")
        print(f"- File Name: {key}")
        print(f"- File Size: {size} bytes")
        print(f"- Upload Time: {time}")

    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps('File info logged successfully')
    }
```

## Q13. What is columnar storage and how does it benefit Redshift performance for analytics workloads?

**Answer:**

**Columnar Storage** is a method of storing data in a database where the data is stored column-wise rather than row-wise. Instead of storing all fields of a single row together, the values of each column are stored sequentially.

**Benefits of Columnar Storage in Redshift for Analytics:**

- **Efficient Data Compression:** Since data in a column tends to be of the same type and similar values, it compresses better, reducing storage costs and speeding up data retrieval.

- **Faster Query Performance:** Analytics queries often involve scanning a subset of columns. Columnar storage allows Redshift to read only the relevant columns, minimizing I/O and improving query speed.

- **Improved Parallel Processing:** Redshift distributes column data across nodes, enabling parallel processing and faster aggregation and filtering operations.

- **Optimized for Aggregations:** Since columns are stored contiguously, aggregation functions like SUM, AVG, COUNT can be computed more efficiently.

**Summary:**
Columnar storage enables Redshift to process large-scale analytic workloads efficiently by reducing I/O, improving compression, and leveraging parallelism.

## Q14.  Load a CSV file from S3 into Redshift using the COPY command. Share table schema, command used, and sample output from a query.

**Answer:**

Loading a CSV File from S3 into Redshift Using the COPY Command

**Table Schema:** 
I created a table named `sales_data` in Amazon Redshift with the following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales_data (
    id INT,
    product_name VARCHAR(100),
    quantity INT,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    sale_date DATE
);
```
**COPY Command Used:**
To load the CSV file from my S3 bucket `(s3://bharat-pw-bucket/csv-data/sales_data.csv)` into the `sales_data` table, I used the following COPY command:

```sql
COPY sales_data
FROM 's3://bharat-pw-bucket/csv-data/sales_data.csv'
IAM_ROLE 'arn:aws:iam::938320847089:role/MyRedshiftS3Role'
CSV
IGNOREHEADER 1
DATEFORMAT 'DD-MM-YYYY';
```
- The `IAM_ROLE` used has permission to access the S3 bucket.

- `IGNOREHEADER 1` skips the header row.

- DATEFORMAT `DD-MM-YYYY` ensures the date column is parsed correctly.

**Output from Query:**

| id | product\_name      | quantity | price  | sale\_date |
| -- | ------------------ | -------- | ------ | ---------- |
| 1  | Apple iPhone 14    | 10       | 799.99 | 2023-05-01 |
| 2  | Samsung Galaxy S23 | 15       | 699.99 | 2023-05-02 |
| 3  | Google Pixel 7     | 8        | 599.99 | 2023-05-03 |

## Q15. What is the role of the AWS Glue Data Catalog in Athena? How does schema-on-read work?

**Answer:**

The **AWS Glue Data Catalog** acts as a centralized metadata repository for Athena. It stores table definitions, schema information, and location details of data stored in Amazon S3. When I query data using Athena, it refers to the Glue Data Catalog to understand the structure of the data files without needing to move or transform the data.

**Schema-on-read** means that Athena applies the schema to the data at the time of the query, not when the data is stored. This allows me to store raw data in S3 in formats like CSV, JSON, or Parquet, and define or change the schema later without reprocessing the data. Athena reads the data files and interprets them according to the schema defined in the Glue Data Catalog only when I run a query, providing great flexibility for analytics on semi-structured or evolving datasets.

---

## Q16. Create an Athena table from S3 data using Glue Catalog. Run a query and share the SQL + result screenshot


**Answer:**

Creating an Athena Table from S3 Data Using Glue Data Catalog and Running a Query

**1. Crawl S3 Data with AWS Glue**

- I uploaded my dataset (CSV files) to the S3 bucket: `s3://bharat-pw-bucket/csv-data/`.
- In AWS Glue, I created a crawler to scan this S3 location.
- The crawler created a database named `csv_database` and a table named `csv_data` in the Glue Data Catalog.

**2. Create Athena Table Using Glue Catalog**

- In the Athena console, I selected the database `csv_database`.
- I found the table `csv_data` automatically created by the Glue crawler.
- No manual table creation SQL was needed as Glue Catalog provided the metadata.

**3. Run a Query in Athena**

I ran a sample query to fetch all records:

```sql
SELECT * FROM csv_database.csv_data LIMIT 10;
```

**4. View Query Results**

- The query successfully returned the data stored in my S3 bucket.

- I took a screenshot of the Athena query editor showing the SQL query and the result table.

**SQL Query Used:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM csv_database.csv_data LIMIT 10;
```

**4. Data Transformation â€“ AWS Glue**

- **Service Used:** `AWS Glue (ETL Jobs)`
- **Purpose:** Cleans, transforms, and prepares data for analytics (e.g., converting CSV to Parquet, removing duplicates).
- **Why Glue?** It's serverless, supports both visual and code-based transformations, and scales automatically.

**5. Query & Analysis â€“ Amazon Athena**

- **Service Used:** `Amazon Athena`
- **Purpose:** SQL-based querying directly on data stored in S3.
- **Why Athena?** Serverless, pay-per-query, and integrates well with Glue Catalog. Great for ad hoc analysis.

**6. Data Warehousing (Optional) â€“ Amazon Redshift**

- **Service Used:** `Amazon Redshift`
- **Purpose:** For complex, high-performance analytics on large structured datasets.
- **Why Redshift?** Best when needing optimized performance on large-scale joins and aggregations.

**7. Visualization â€“ Amazon QuickSight**

- **Service Used:** `Amazon QuickSight`
- **Purpose:** Create interactive dashboards, reports, and business intelligence visualizations.
- **Why QuickSight?** It's serverless, integrates with Athena, Redshift, and S3, and uses SPICE for fast performance.

**Bonus: Monitoring & Auditing**

- **CloudWatch:** Monitors ETL job metrics, Lambda invocations, system performance.
- **CloudTrail:** Tracks user activities and access logs across the pipeline.
